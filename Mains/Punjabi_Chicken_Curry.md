## Method
 1. Heat the oil in a large, heavy-bottomed saucepan over a medium heat. Add ½ teaspoon of the ground cumin, the cinnamon stick and cardamom. As they begin to sizzle, add the onions and cook for 15–16 minutes, stirring well and making sure they don’t stick to the pan.
 2. Add the garlic and ginger and fry for 1 minute. Add the turmeric and chilli powder, then stir. Add the blended tomatoes and cook for 5–7 minutes.
 3. Add the chicken and cook for 10 minutes. Stir well, making sure the masala coats the chicken.
 4. Add the stock and salt to taste and simmer over a low heat with the lid on for 20 minutes, or until the chicken is cooked through, stirring halfway through. Turn the heat off and add the remaining cumin, the garam masala and fresh coriander. Serve with roti or rice.
