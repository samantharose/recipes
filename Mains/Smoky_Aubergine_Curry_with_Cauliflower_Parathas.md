## Method
 1. To make the cauliflower paratha dough, sift the flour into a bowl, then add the salt and gradually pour in 80ml–100ml water (the amount you need will depend on the flours you are using) mixing with your hands until a dough forms. If it feels dry, add a little more water. Knead until smooth and elastic. Shape into a ball and brush or rub the top with a teaspoon of oil. Cover the bowl with a cloth and leave to rest for 15–20 minutes at room temperature.
 2. To make the cauliflower filling, mix the ingredients together in a bowl and set aside.
 3. To make the curry, cook the aubergines under a very hot grill for 10 minutes, turning regularly until blackened on all sides. (You can also do this carefully over a gas flame.) Leave until cool enough to handle, then strip off the blackened skin and discard. Mash the flesh in a large bowl and set aside.
 4. Heat 2 tablespoons of the oil in a large frying pan over a medium heat and add the cumin seeds. As soon as they start to sizzle, add the garlic and cook for 1 minute, stirring, then add the onion and cook for a further 4–5 minutes, stirring constantly. Once softened, stir in the chillies, chopped tomatoes and coriander and cook for 2–3 minutes more. Stir in the remaining oil, the rest of the spices, salt and the aubergine flesh and cook together over a medium heat for 4–5 minutes, stirring regularly. Keep warm until ready to serve.
 5. Meanwhile, divide the paratha dough into 4 balls. Dust the work surface with flour and roll the dough into 4 thin discs, each around 14cm. Spread 2 of the discs with the cauliflower filling, leaving a 15mm border around the edge. Brush the edges with a little cold water then place the remaining discs on top. Press firmly, sprinkle with a little more flour and roll out carefully to 17–19cm diameter (don't press too hard when rolling or the filling will break through the dough).
 6. Heat a large non-stick frying pan over a medium heat and dry fry the parathas, one at a time, for around 40–60 seconds on each side, until small blisters form on the surface of the dough. Put the first paratha on a plate while you cook the second one. Brush generously with oil on both sides and fry again until golden and starting to crisp.
 7. Add an extra splash of water if the curry appears too dry and stir in a knob of buter for a glossy finish. Spoon the curry into 2 bowls, scatter over some coriander and serve with the cauliflower parathas alongside.
