Cooking time: 40 minutes

## Ingredients
  + 1kg boneless chicken breasts, cut into big chunks
  + 1.5tsp ground black peppercorns and coriander seeds
  + 0.75tsp garam masala (blend of indian spices, which you'll find in your local supermarket)
  + 1tsp paprika
  + 1.5tsp turmeric
  + 0.5tsp red chilli flakes
  + 2 fresh tomatoes, sliced
  + handful of fresh coriander, chopped
  + 3 bay leaves
  + 450ml water

  For the tarka masala sauce:
  + 3tbsp sunflower oil, ghee or olive oil
  + 2tsp cumin seeds
  + 2 medium onions, peeled and chopped
  + 1 head of garlic, cloves peeled and chopped
  + small tin of chopped tomatoes
  + 5cm piece of root ginger, peeled and chopped
  + 2 whole green chillies

## Method
 1. Wash the chicken and drain it well.
 2. For the tarka masala sauce: Heat the oil in a large pan until fairly hot, add the cumin seeds and fry for 10 seconds. Add the onions and fry until golden brown, then add the garlic and fry until slightly golden. Drain the tomatoes (keep the juice) and add them to the pan. Next add the ginger, chillies and cook until the oil begins to separate.
 3. Put the chicken, salt, spices and chilli flakes into the pan and cook over a fairly high heat. Keep turning the chicken and continue to cook until the meat is sealed and browned and the liquid has evaporated. Add the juice from the can of tomatoes and about 450ml of water, bring to the boil and simmer over a medium heat for about 15 minutes or until the chicken is tender. Add the fresh tomatoes about 3 minutes before the end of the cooking time.
 4. Sprinkle in the fresh coriander and bay leaves and serve with chapatis, boiled rice or puris (Indian bread).
