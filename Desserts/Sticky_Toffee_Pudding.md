# Sticky Toffee Pudding
Serves 6

Prep time: 30 minutes

Cooking time: 1 hour

## Ingredients
  + 200g pitted dates, roughly chopped
  + 1tsp bicarbonate of soda
  + 300ml boiling water
  + 50g butter, plus extra for greating
  + 75g light soft brown sugar
  + 75g dark muscovado sugar
  + 2 free-range eggs
  + 175g self-raising flour

  For the sauce:
  + 125g butter
  + 75g light soft brown sugar
  + 50g dark muscovado sugar
  + 200ml double or whipping cream
  + pinch of salt

## Method
 1. Preheat the oven to 180°C (160°C fan). Butter an ovenproof dish - either a large traditional oval one or a brownie tin of around 20x30cm (8x12inch).
 2. Put the dates and bicarbonate of soda into a bowl and cover with the boiling water. Leave to stand.
 3. Cream together the butter and sugars into a bowl until very soft and fluffy. Add the eggs, one at a time, adding a heaped tablespoon of flour with each addition, then add the rest of the flour.
 4. Add all the dates and their soaking water and stir briefly to combine. Pour into the prepared dish. Bake in the oven for 25-30 minutes, or until springy to the touch and slightly shrinking away from the sides.
 5. While the pudding is baking, make the sauce. Put all the ingredients into a saucepan, stirring until the butter has melted and the sugars have dissolved. Turn up the heat and bring to the boil, then simmer for a few minutes, until the sauce has thickened to the consistency of a light custard (that is it should coat the back of a spoon).
 6. While the pudding is still hot, poke holes over the surface and pour over half the sauce. Set the rest of the sauce aside. Leave to stand for a while – the pudding can be left for a couple of days and will just get stickier. Serve warmed through again with the rest of the sauce, also warmed through.
