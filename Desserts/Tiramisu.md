# Tiramisu
Serves 6

Prep time: 15 minutes

## Ingredients
  + 500g carton mascarpone cheese
  + 90g caster sugar
  + 30g dark chocolate, finely grated
  + 2-3 level tsp instant coffee granules
  + 100ml Tia Maria (or any other liquer)
  + 24-30 amaretti biscuits, plus 4-6 biscuits to decorate
  + (optional) cocoa powder

## Method
 1. Beat the mascarpone until softened, then beat in the sugar. Reserve 1 tbsp grated chocolate and beat in the rest.
 2. Dissolve the coffee in 1 tbsp boiling water and stir in the Tia Maria. Pour the coffee mixture over the amaretti biscuits on a deep plate and leave to soak for 1 minute. Put a soaked biscuit at the bottom of each glass. Add 1 tsp of the coffee liquid to each one, reserving the rest of the liquid for later.
 3. Divide half the mascarpone mixture between the glasses, and then top with the remaining soaked amaretti biscuits. Spoon on the rest of the mascarpone and pour the remaining coffee mixture over it.
 4. Decorate with the extra amaretti biscuits and sprinkle over the reserved grated chocolate.
 5. (optional) Sprinkle cocoa powder over the tiramisu.
