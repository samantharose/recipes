# Salted Peanut Butter Chocolate Cake
Serves 12

## Ingredients
  Cake:
  + 250g salted butter, softened
  + 250g caster sugar
  + 190g self-raising flour
  + 60g good cocoa powder (Green and Black's recommended)
  + 2tsp baking powder, sifted
  + 1tsp vanilla extract
  + 4 large eggs
  + 100ml milk

  Frosting:
  + 200g unsalted butter, softened
  + 200g smooth peanut butter
  + 1tsp vanilla extract
  + 0.25tsp salt, or to taste
  + 300g icing sugar
  + 15ml milk

  Filling:
  + 4tbsp tinned caramel
  + (optional) caramel shards
  + 60g granulated sugar

## Method
 1. Preheat the oven to 190°C (170°C fan). Grease and base-line a 20cm loose-based deep tin. Put all the cake ingredients in a food processor and whizz until smooth. If you don't have a processor, use the creaming method from any Victoria Sandwich recipe. Turn the mixture into the tin, smooth over and bake for 50 minutes or until risen and a skewer comes out clean. Cool in the tin for 5 minutes, then turn onto a rack.
 2. For the frosting, beat together the butter and peanut butter until light and fluffy. Add the vanilla extract and salt, then beat in the icing sugar with the milk for 3 minutes or so.
 3. (optional) For the caramel shards, sprinkle the sugar in a single layer on an A4-sized sheet of good kitchen foil on a baking tray. Grill until it melts and goes deep brown - but don't let it burn. Allow to cool. As you peel back the foil, the shards will form.
 4. Split the cake in two. Pipe two rounds of frosting around the perimeter of the base cake to form a 'wall', then spoon the caramel into the middle. Top with the other half cake and pipe on the remaining frosting. (optional) Decorate with shards just before serving.
